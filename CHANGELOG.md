# Changelog

## Version 1.1.0 (2026-02-05)

### 🔒 SECURITY FOUNDATION UPDATE

**Major philosophical shift:** This is now positioned as **mandatory core infrastructure**, not an optional convenience tool.

### Added

**CORE-PRINCIPLE.md** - New document establishing:
- `.env` is MANDATORY, not optional
- Why centralized credential management is non-negotiable
- The security rationale for this approach
- Implementation requirements for all skills
- Zero exceptions policy

**enforce.py** - New validation script:
- `require_secure_env()` - Enforce .env security before running
- `get_credential()` - Safe credential loading with validation
- Fail-fast system: refuses to run if credentials insecure
- Can be imported by other skills to enforce standard

### Changed

**SKILL.md:**
- Updated description to emphasize "MANDATORY" status
- Added "This Is Not Optional" warning
- New "The Foundation" section explaining requirements
- Added "For Skill Developers" section showing enforcement usage
- Clearer security messaging throughout

**README.md:**
- Repositioned as "Core Security Infrastructure"
- Added "Why This Matters" section upfront
- Emphasized mandatory nature in opening
- Updated status badge to reflect infrastructure role

### Technical Details

**Package size:** 22 KB (was 15 KB)
**Files:** 10 total
- 3 documentation files (SKILL.md, README.md, CORE-PRINCIPLE.md)
- 5 scripts (scan, consolidate, validate, enforce, cleanup)
- 2 references (security, supported-services)

### Philosophy

**Before:** "Use this skill to organize your credentials"
**After:** "Your OpenClaw deployment is non-compliant until credentials are consolidated"

This isn't a feature request. It's a security requirement.
